- [If relevant, how do world events create context or complications?]

**Gossip & News:**
- What rumors would reach the player's location?
- What major news would NPCs be discussing?

---

## Session Checkpoints

Each checkpoint generated during this scenario should reference:
- IN-GAME DATE (critical)
- Current location
- Session number
- Status of major threads
- Next likely scenes or plot developments

**See:** [[Checkpoint_Template]] for full checkpoint structure

---

## Integration

After scenario conclusion:

1. **Update Master Calendar** — Add major events to [[Master_Calendar]]
2. **Note consequences** — Document how this scenario's outcome affects future scenarios
3. **Update Between-Scenario Gap** — If another scenario follows, document what happened in the gap
4. **Archive** — Save scenario log to [[Stories]] directory for reference
